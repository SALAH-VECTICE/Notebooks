    "In most machine learning projects the data that you have to work with is unlikely to be in the ideal format for producing the best performing model. There are quite often a number of transformational steps such as encoding categorical variables, feature scaling and normalisation that need to be performed. Scikit-learn has built in functions for most of these commonly used transformations in it’s preprocessing package.\n",
    "However, in a typical machine learning workflow you will need to apply all these transformations at least twice. Once when training the model and again on any new data you want to predict on. Of course you could write a function to apply them and reuse that but you would still need to run this first and then call the model separately. Scikit-learn pipelines are a tool to simplify this process. They have several key benefits:\n",
    "* They make your workflow much easier to read and understand.\n",

In the basic approach, called k-fold CV, the training set is split into k smaller sets (other approaches are described below, but generally follow the same principles). The following procedure is followed for each of the k “folds”:\n",

    "- A model is trained using of the folds as training data;\n",

This approach can be computationally expensive, but does not waste too much data (as is the case when fixing an arbitrary validation set), which is a major advantage in problems such as inverse inference where the number of samples is very small.\n",
